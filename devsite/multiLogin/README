Integrated login script for obtaining ACCESS TOKENS from Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn and Google.

First you have to register an APP at the service(s) you require (Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn and Google).
Using the information you have after registering your APP you fill in the details in the Application.cfc.


Next we have have some buttons so you can choose the login method  :-

This send you to the processLogin.cfm page where the initiate_login method is called, in the login.cfc, with the correct parameters :-
The initiate_login method makes a CFHTTP request to the server in question and you login as normal.
The server then processes your login and send control back to the processLogin.cfm.
At this point we have an AUTHORISATION CODE.


Now Based on how you login the processLogin.cfm now calls the authorise_login method.


Now the authorise_login method sends a CFHTTP request to the server and asks for an ACCESS TOKEN.
The server sends back a response which contains the ACCESS TOKEN that is stored as an application variable that you can now
use to initiate API calls to the service you logged into.




The Facebook, Google and LinkedIn code is coursety of Raymond Camden ( @cfjedimaster ) :-

The Twitter code is a combination of code taken from Dave Delbridge (for the User Authorisation) and Twitter4J ( for the API Calls ) :-

	The Authoristaion portion is from http://www.delbridge.org/post.cfm/tackling-twitter-s-oauth-with-coldfusion
	(I took the separate pages and made them into a cfc)

	The Twitter API code uses http://twitter4j.org/en/index.html for the API Calls as GET does not work in Dave Delbridge's code
	
	To get the twitter4j to load I just put
	twitter4j-core-3.0.3.jar into C:\ColdFusion10\cfusion\wwwroot\WEB-INF\lib
